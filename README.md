# Optimizing Fiber Geometry

This repository contains simulation files and papers related to optimizing a fiber's cross-section during the draw process using simulated data and machine learning.

To get the repository, you need `git-lfs` because the comsol file is around 900 MB.  On windows, this should be already installed with git.  Then, wherever you want to clone the repository run 
```shell
git-lfs install
git lfs clone https://github.com/jefferycoulter/fiber-optim.git
```
For other operating systems such as linux, you can see for instance [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48734119/git-lfs-is-not-a-git-command-unclear).
